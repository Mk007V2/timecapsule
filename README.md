# Timecapsule
An application that allows sending a message to an email address in the future.

I have used Gemini 2.5 Flash to write the most of the code here, so the code is not fully efficient and refactored.

AI button does not use actual AI, cuz I could not integrate free AI tools.

Implemented API on Python Flask, which is running on port 5000.
Implemented web page on React, styled using TailWindCSS.

To deploy, first run
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-apscheduler flask-cors werkzeug
