# Timecapsule
An application that allows sending a message to an email address in the future.

I have used Gemini 2.5 Flash to write the most of the code here, so the code is not fully efficient and refactored.

It is now in the Level 2 stage.

Implemented API on Python Flask, which is running on port 5000.
Implemented web page on React, styled using TailWindCSS.

Will update README once I deploy it or Add AI assisting tools into web page.
